# 🌐 Node.js Projects

This repository contains projects I built while learning and practicing **Node.js**.  
It showcases both API development and a deployed **fullstack application**.

## 📚 Part 1: Build a Node API ✅ (Completed)

In this section, I focused on using Node.js **without external frameworks** to understand the core fundamentals of backend development.  

### Key Topics Covered
- Core Node.js modules (`http`, `fs`, `url`, `path`)  
- Creating a server with the `http` module  
- Handling requests and responses  
- Parsing URLs and query parameters  
- Serving JSON responses  
- Modularizing code with utility functions  
- Filtering data based on client query params  
- Designing clean and reusable API endpoints  

### Mini Project
Built an `/api` endpoint that serves destination data and supports query filters such as:  
- `country`  
- `continent`  
- `is_open_to_public`

## 🚀 Part 2: Build a Fullstack Node App ✅ (Completed & Live)

In this project, I built a **fullstack Node.js application** that integrates frontend and backend into one platform.  

### What I Implemented
- Served a frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) from the Node backend  
- Implemented **GET** requests to fetch and display data  
- Implemented **POST** requests to accept and store new data from users  
- Structured the project into modules and utilities for cleaner code  
- Deployed the app successfully to a live server  

### Live Demo

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Node.js** (no frameworks, raw `http` + core modules)  
- **JavaScript (ES Modules)**  
- **sanitize-html** for input sanitization  
- **JSON** for mock data storage  
- **Render** for deployment

## 💡 How to Run Locally
1. Clone this repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Khan4218/node-express-journey.git
   cd node-express-journey/Full-stack-Node-App/Main-Project

1. Install dependencies
- npm install
2. Run the server
- npm start
3. Visit the app at:
- http://localhost:8000/

✨ This journey helped me strengthen my understanding of Node.js internals, request handling, and deployment.
